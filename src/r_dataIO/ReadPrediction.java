 *         A class used to read the prediction points from the R prediction
 *         algorithms. it reads the points from a csv file where the columns
 *         represent the matches of the competition the day of the prediction
 *         and the lines represent the values as : **************************
 *         row1 - head1; row2 - headx, row3 - head2 **************************
 *         row4 - over, row5 - under, row6 - p1Y, row7 - p1N, ****************
 *         row8 - p2Y, row9 - p2N, row10 - totHt, row11 - totFt; *************
 *         Should contain functions to read, infere the most probable outcome
 *         vector for every match and somehow coordinate and facilitate the
 *         display or send data from the service class
