--) we are in the phase to calculate the db necessary components for the competition table attributes calculation
taking in consideration the match in hand.

---) TO calculate the isTopTeam, isP3, isP3Up or p3Down a structure with all the teams and their points is needed.
	  So an addition query and analog data structure is needed at structures. Instead of taking all the 
	  teamtable attributes for all the teams it would be more memory effective to get just teamName and points.
	  

***) we are at the point where we are trying to implement the teamtable attributes calculation when the matches are inserted
	 for the first time and in case of renewal for the next match.
	 These are all untested. 
	 procedure to be tested 
	 						get matches
	 						calculate attributes
	 						set tables ready
	 						store / update to db
	 						
--) A problem we might be having is the empty ht values from competition matches that don't have them.
	Security Measures Required	 
	
	
--) i changed a bit the structure so now we dont have two types of entity classes but one basic that extends another 
	one with the HT attributes. 
	
***) Re-think and Redesign the architecture to keep in ming the continuous/big amount of games per each competition.
	 To skip some calculation for the first 3 weeks of games (like tt, p3 up& down, form) since at the 
	 beginning all the teams are in the same situation.
